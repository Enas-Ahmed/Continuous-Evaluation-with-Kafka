# Continuous-Evaluation-with-Kafka

## Introduction
In this assignment, I will implement a binary classifier aimed at predicting data exfiltration via DNS. The assignment is divided into two parts:

### Part I (Static Model): 
Train a static Machine Learning Model based on batch data.
### Part II (Dynamic Model): 
Simulate a real-life scenario of a constant data stream and make predictions on the new data that arrives in real-time, comparing the performance of a static and a dynamic model.

## Tasks
### Part I (Static Model):
##### Data Analysis
##### Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning
##### Feature Filtering/Selection
##### Model Training
##### Model Evaluation
### Part II (Dynamic Model):
##### Install Docker, create images, and set up Kafka.
##### Use the "Kafka_dataset.csv" file to deploy the producer's task.
##### Load the saved model from Part I and create two models: one for the dynamic analysis and one for the static analysis.
##### Evaluate the dynamic model's performance and decide when to retrain the model.
##### Evaluate the performance of both the static and dynamic models, and compare their results.
##### Describe the results and conclude whether the dynamic implementation is better or not compared to the traditional static model.

## Deliverables
### Two Jupyter Notebook files:
##### 1- Static_model.ipynb
##### 2- Dynamic_model.ipynb
### A 5-page PDF report covering all the required points.
